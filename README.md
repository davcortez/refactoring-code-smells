### 💩 Code Smells

The different Code Smells are grouped based on the following taxonomy ([source](https://mmantyla.github.io/BadCodeSmellsTaxonomy)) where you will find each one of the single examples:

* Bloaters: Something that has grown so large that it cannot be effectively handled
* Object-Orientation Abusers: Solutions that does not fully exploit the possibilities of object-oriented design
* Change Preventers: hinder changing or further developing the software
* Dispensables: Something unnecessary that should be removed from the source code
* Couplers: Promotes coupling (knowledge particularities) between different classes

## 🤯 How to explore this repository

You have the following 2 main folders and a PDF of the talk:
